# Hello, sled!

This is an initial experiment with [sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled), an embedded database written in rust. ðŸ¦€ ðŸ’¾ ðŸŒŸ

## What We Found

We created an [example program](src/main.rs) based on the documentation.  It wasn't too hard to figure that out based
on looking only at the first paragraph of of sled's README!

```text
$ du -h /tmp/sledding-attempt/

4.0K    /tmp/sledding-attempt/blobs
20K     /tmp/sledding-attempt/
